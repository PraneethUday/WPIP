## Overview

**GigGuard** is an AI-enabled parametric insurance platform designed exclusively for platform-based delivery partners in India (Zomato, Swiggy, Zepto, Amazon, Blinkit, etc.). It protects their **income** — not their vehicles or health — against uncontrollable external disruptions such as extreme weather, severe pollution, and sudden curfews.

GigGuard operates on a **weekly pricing model** aligned with the gig worker's earnings cycle, and uses **machine learning** to dynamically compute premiums and automate the claims process with near-zero human intervention.

---

## The Problem

India's gig delivery workforce is the backbone of the digital economy. However, workers are fully exposed to external disruptions — heavy rainfall, floods, AQI spikes, curfews — that can wipe out **20–30% of their monthly earnings** with no safety net. No existing insurance product is designed around the week-to-week financial reality of a delivery partner.

---

## Our Solution

GigGuard solves this with three core pillars:

1. **AI-Powered Weekly Premiums** — Dynamic, hyper-local risk pricing computed weekly using ML models trained on weather, location, and earnings history.
2. **Parametric Automation** — Real-time monitoring of disruption triggers (rain, AQI, curfew data). When a threshold is crossed, claims are automatically initiated and payouts processed — no manual claim filing required.
3. **Intelligent Fraud Detection** — Anomaly detection, GPS validation, and duplicate prevention to ensure payout integrity.

> **Coverage Scope:** Income loss ONLY. We strictly exclude health, life, accidents, and vehicle repair coverage.

## Persona & Persona-Based Scenarios

### 🎯 Chosen Persona: Food Delivery Partners (Zomato / Swiggy)

Food delivery riders are the most weather-sensitive segment — two-wheeler riders who operate outdoors across all hours and cannot work in extreme rain, heat, or poor visibility. They are paid per delivery and lose income the moment deliveries stop.

---

### 📖 Scenario 1 — Heavy Rainfall (Environmental Disruption)

**Character:** Ravi, a Zomato delivery partner in Chennai, working 10 hours/day, earning ₹700/day.

**Event:** IMD issues a Red Alert for Chennai. Rainfall exceeds 64.5mm in 24 hours (Extreme Rain threshold). Zomato suspends delivery operations in affected zones.

**GigGuard Response:**
- Weather API detects rainfall threshold breach at 6:14 AM.
- GigGuard automatically creates a claim for Ravi's policy covering that disruption window.
- AI validates: Ravi's GPS confirms he was in the active zone; no deliveries were logged; no duplicate claim exists.
- Payout of ₹350 (50% of daily wage for 5 disrupted hours) is transferred to Ravi's UPI/bank in under 10 minutes.
- Ravi receives a WhatsApp/app notification: *"GigGuard has credited ₹350 to your account for today's disruption."*

---

### 📖 Scenario 2 — Severe Air Pollution (Environmental Disruption)

**Character:** Priya, a Swiggy delivery partner in Delhi, 8 hours/day, ₹600/day average.

**Event:** AQI in Priya's zone crosses 401 (Severe category). Delhi government issues a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) advisory halting two-wheeler movement.

**GigGuard Response:**
- AQI API detects threshold breach (>400) in Priya's registered zone.
- Parametric trigger fires; GigGuard auto-initiates claim.
- Fraud engine checks: GPS confirms Priya was not working (no delivery pings), cross-references GRAP bulletin.
- Payout processed for lost hours. Priya does not need to file anything manually.

---

### 📖 Scenario 3 — Unplanned Curfew / Section 144 (Social Disruption)

**Character:** Arjun, a Swiggy rider in Bengaluru, working evening slots (5 PM – 11 PM).

**Event:** Local authorities impose a sudden Section 144 curfew in a 3-km radius following unrest. Arjun's zone is locked down for 4 hours during his peak earning window.

**GigGuard Response:**
- GigGuard ingests government notification feeds and news APIs.
- Curfew zone is matched against Arjun's registered delivery zone.
- Parametric trigger fires; claim auto-created for the disrupted 4-hour window.
- Payout released after fraud validation confirms inactivity in Arjun's delivery logs.

## Weekly Premium Model — How It Works

### Why Weekly?

Gig workers operate week-to-week. Daily income is variable. A monthly premium model does not align with their cash flow — they may not have ₹200 upfront but can afford ₹40–60 per week, auto-deducted from platform payouts.

---

### Dynamic Premium Calculation (ML-Driven)

The weekly premium is **not flat**. It is dynamically computed every week using our ML model based on the following factors:

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `zone_risk_score` | Historical disruption frequency in the worker's delivery zone | High-flood zone in Mumbai = higher score |
| `weather_forecast_7d` | Predicted weather severity for the upcoming week (OpenWeatherMap API) | Red alert forecast = premium ↑ |
| `aqi_forecast_7d` | Air Quality Index prediction for the zone | AQI > 300 forecast = premium ↑ |
| `worker_earnings_avg` | 4-week rolling average daily earnings (from platform API) | Higher earnings = higher coverage = adjusted premium |
| `historical_claim_rate` | Zone-level claim frequency from past data | High claim zone = slight premium ↑ |
| `worker_risk_profile` | Individual worker's hours worked, zone switches, reliability score | Stable worker = loyalty discount |
| `public_holiday_flag` | Government holiday calendar check | Holiday week = lower disruption risk |
| `platform_surge_forecast` | Predicted high-demand days (e.g., weekends, festivals) | High surge = more earnings at risk = higher coverage need |

---

### Premium Formula (Simplified)

```
Base Premium = Weekly Earnings Avg × Coverage Rate (5–8%)

Dynamic Multiplier = f(zone_risk_score, weather_forecast, aqi_forecast)

Final Weekly Premium = Base Premium × Dynamic Multiplier × Loyalty Discount

Coverage Payout = Disrupted Hours × (Weekly Earnings Avg / Active Hours in Week)
```

**Example:**
- Ravi's 4-week average earnings: ₹4,200/week
- Base coverage rate: 6% → Base Premium = ₹252
- Zone risk multiplier: 1.1 (moderate flood zone, Chennai)
- Weather forecast multiplier: 1.2 (heavy rain predicted)
- Loyalty discount: 0.95 (3+ months continuous policy)
- **Final Premium = ₹252 × 1.1 × 1.2 × 0.95 = ₹315.72 → rounded to ₹316/week**

---

### Premium Tiers (Indicative)

| Coverage Tier | Weekly Premium | Max Weekly Payout | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Basic Shield | ₹30–60 | ₹500 | Part-time riders |
| Standard Guard | ₹60–120 | ₹1,200 | Full-time riders |
| Pro Protect | ₹120–220 | ₹2,500 | High-earning riders |

> The ML model selects the most appropriate tier automatically and allows the worker to upgrade/downgrade.

---

## Parametric Triggers

Parametric insurance means: **the event data triggers the claim — not a manual complaint**. When a pre-defined measurable threshold is crossed, the system acts.

### Trigger Table

| Trigger ID | Disruption Type | Data Source | Threshold | Payout Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `T-01` | Heavy Rainfall | OpenWeatherMap / IMD API | Rainfall > 64.5mm/24h (Red Alert) OR > 35.5mm/3h | Auto-claim for affected zone |
| `T-02` | Extreme Heat | OpenWeatherMap | Temperature > 45°C AND Heat Index > 54°C | Auto-claim if active in zone |
| `T-03` | Severe Air Pollution | CPCB AQI API / OpenAQ | AQI > 400 (Severe) AND official advisory issued | Auto-claim for GRAP-restricted zones |
| `T-04` | Flood / Waterlogging | OpenWeatherMap + Google Maps Traffic API | Zone tagged as flooded / road closures detected | Auto-claim for registered zone |
| `T-05` | Curfew / Section 144 | Government notification RSS / News API | Official order detected in registered zone | Auto-claim for disrupted window |

### How Triggers Work

```
Every 15 minutes:
  ├── Poll all data sources for active worker zones
  ├── Compare against thresholds
  ├── If threshold crossed → flag disruption event
  ├── Match event zone to policies active in that zone
  ├── Run fraud validation pipeline
  └── If valid → auto-initiate claim and payout
```

## AI/ML Integration

### 1. Dynamic Premium Calculation (Scikit-learn / XGBoost)

- **Model Type:** Gradient Boosted Regression (XGBoost)
- **Training Data:** Synthetic + historical weather events, IMD disruption records, simulated delivery platform earnings data
- **Features:** Zone risk score, weather forecast, AQI forecast, earnings avg, claim history, holiday calendar
- **Output:** Weekly premium amount (₹) + recommended coverage tier
- **Retraining:** Model retrained weekly with new disruption event outcomes

### 2. Fraud Detection Engine (Isolation Forest + Rule-Based Layer)

- **Model Type:** Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection) + hard rule checks
- **Fraud Signals Detected:**
  - GPS location mismatch (worker not in claimed disruption zone)
  - Delivery activity detected during claimed disruption window (platform API cross-check)
  - Duplicate claim submission (same worker, same event, multiple policies)
  - Abnormal claim frequency relative to zone peers
  - GPS spoofing detection (sudden unrealistic location jumps)
- **Output:** Fraud risk score (0–1). Score > 0.75 flags for manual review; Score > 0.9 auto-rejects.

### 3. Risk Profiling (Clustering + Scoring)

- **Model Type:** K-Means clustering for zone-level risk segmentation + logistic scoring for worker profile
- **Purpose:** Assign each delivery zone a risk tier (Low / Medium / High / Extreme) based on historical disruption frequency, drainage quality, curfew history
- **Worker-level:** Individual risk score considering zone history, hours worked, account age, claim history

### 4. Predictive Analytics Dashboard (For Insurers)

- **Model:** Time-series forecasting (Prophet / LSTM) to predict next week's likely claim volume by zone
- **Output:** Insurer dashboard showing predicted loss ratio, zone-wise exposure, upcoming high-risk days
