# WPIP Presentation Document

## 1. Project Overview

WPIP: Worker Protection Insurance Platform is an AI-enabled parametric insurance system for delivery workers in India.

Core goal:

- Protect weekly income when external disruptions stop deliveries.

Coverage focus:

- Income-loss protection only.
- Not a health, life, or vehicle damage policy.

Primary worker platforms supported today:

- Swiggy
- Zomato
- Amazon Flex
- Blinkit
- Zepto
- Meesho
- Porter
- Dunzo

## 2. Problem We Solve

Gig workers are exposed to events they cannot control:

- Heavy rain
- Flooding
- Severe air pollution
- Extreme heat
- Curfew/restriction windows

When disruptions happen, workers lose paid delivery time immediately. Traditional insurance does not match their weekly earning cycle.

WPIP addresses this with:

- Weekly premiums
- Automated trigger-based claims
- Fast payout workflow
- Fraud-aware validations

## 3. What Is Special About WPIP

Key differentiators:

- Parametric insurance model: event threshold triggers claim workflow.
- Multi-platform worker support: one worker can be active on multiple delivery apps.
- Dynamic premium estimation using ML and weather risk.
- Hybrid fraud engine: Isolation Forest support plus rule-based scoring.
- Automatic claim creation from live trigger polling.
- Mobile-first worker experience and web-based operational control center.

## 7. Methods and Engineering Approaches Used

### 7.1 Synthetic Data Generation Method

Current data source strategy:

- Synthetic worker activity generation for development and model training bootstrap.

How it works:

- Creates a persistent pool of about 200 workers.
- Evenly distributes workers across 8 platforms.
- Generates daily deliveries, earnings, active hours, rating, city data.
- Adds weekend boosts and occasional anomaly spikes.
- Uses deterministic worker IDs for consistent identity across runs.
- Upserts by worker_id + date to keep daily records idempotent.

### 7.2 Weather and Air-Quality Integration Method

External data source:

- OpenWeatherMap APIs:
  - Current weather
  - Air pollution

Signals ingested:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Rain (1h and 3h)
- Wind speed
- AQI proxy mapped to a 0-500 style index
- PM2.5 and PM10

Reliability method:

- In-memory weather cache with TTL.
- Fallback default weather profile on API failure.

### 7.3 Premium Prediction Method (ML + Fallback)

Model approach:

- XGBoost regressor for weekly premium estimation.

Feature engineering includes:

- Rolling 7-day earnings, deliveries, hours, rating
- 3-day vs 7-day trend features
- Earnings volatility (coefficient of variation)
- Efficiency metrics (earn per hour, earn per delivery)
- Weather and AQI risk features
- City risk weighting

Output behavior:

- Tier-aware premium prediction.
- AutoPay discounted premium variant.
- Tier-based payout caps.

Fallback method:

- If trained model is not available, backend computes premium using rule/formula approach.

### 7.4 Retraining Method

Retrain pipeline:

- Pull latest worker histories.
- Fetch current city weather snapshots.
- Build training dataset.
- Train and evaluate XGBoost.
- Save new model only if quality is acceptable vs previous model.
- Persist metadata and top feature importance.

Scheduler behavior:

- Auto-retrain runs periodically from scheduler loop.
- Manual retrain trigger endpoint available in control center.

### 7.5 Fraud Detection Method

Hybrid strategy:

- Isolation Forest model support for anomaly detection.
- Rule-based scoring fallback for robust operation.

Fraud signals used:

- Cross-platform activity during disruption window
- Missing/failed GPS verification
- High claim frequency over recent window
- High payout ratio vs daily wage
- High cumulative payout trend

Fraud decisioning:

- Claims below threshold can stay auto-initiated/approved.
- High-risk claims move to under-review state.

### 7.6 Parametric Trigger Method

Trigger polling:

- Trigger worker evaluates city weather/AQI regularly.

Current trigger set:

- T-01 heavy rain
- T-02 extreme heat
- T-03 severe AQI
- T-04 flood risk
- T-05 traffic
- T-06 curfew placeholder

Event handling method:

- Upsert one disruption event per trigger/city/date.
- Idempotent conflict key prevents duplicate event rows.

### 7.7 Automatic Claims Method

When trigger fires:

1. Identify workers in affected city.
2. Estimate daily wage from recent history.
3. Compute payout with policy caps.
4. Run cross-platform activity check.
5. Run GPS proximity validation.
6. Build fraud features and score claim.
7. Upsert claim row with status and fraud metadata.

### 7.8 Payment and Payout Method

Current implementation:

- Mock payout execution endpoint for approved claims.
- Generates transaction IDs and marks claims paid.
- Web payment endpoint supports UPI/debit/credit modes.
- Payment history endpoint exposes worker-specific records.

Note:

- Current web payment history uses an in-memory payment store, so persistence is process-lifetime.

## 8. Backend Responsibilities (What Backend Does Today)

FastAPI backend currently handles:

- Authentication (register, login, token verification, profile fetch)
- Delivery ID verification against selected platform tables
- Premium prediction and premium listing
- Weather endpoints for city and monitored set
- Model status and retrain controls

- Data summary and income adjustment admin endpoints
- Trigger status and disruption listing
- Claims listing and worker-specific claim retrieval
- Test-fire trigger endpoint for scenario simulation
- Payout execution endpoint for approved claims
- GPS check-in endpoint
- Regional exposure summary endpoint

## 9. Database and Data Model (Current)

Major table groups:

- Platform worker tables (8 separate platform tables)
- Registered workers table
- Premium predictions table
- Weather cache table
- Disruption events table
- Claims table
- GPS check-ins table

Design patterns used:

- Upsert-heavy writes for idempotent scheduler execution
- Composite uniqueness for event and claim deduplication
